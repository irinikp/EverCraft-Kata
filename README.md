# EverCraft-Kata

This is my solution on [EverCart-Kata](https://github.com/PuttingTheDnDInTDD/EverCraft-Kata)
Each folder contains the solution after I finished each Iteration, so as difference based on requirements could be easier seen

All code is written in PHP

[Iteration 1 - Core](Iteration1/)

[Iteration 2 - Classes](Iteration2/)

[Iteration 3 - Races](Iteration3/)

[Iteration 4 - Weapons, Armor & Items](Iteration4/)
